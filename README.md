# CRICKET-WIN-PREDICTION
🏏 Cricket Match Win Predictor
This project predicts the winning team of a cricket match (e.g., IPL, T20) using machine learning models trained on real match data. The prediction is based on current match statistics like score, wickets, overs, venue, and toss information.

🔍 Features
Predicts winner during live match scenarios (based on current score)

Uses match data including team, venue, toss, overs, runs, and wickets

Machine Learning model built using Random Forest / XGBoost

Interactive Streamlit web app for user-friendly prediction

Visualizations to show probability and outcome insights

📊 Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)

Machine Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost

Web App: Streamlit

Dataset: IPL Match Data from Kaggle

🧠 How It Works
Preprocess historical match data (e.g., IPL)

Engineer features: run rate, required rate, wickets left, etc.

Train an ML model to predict the match winner

Deploy with a Streamlit interface for real-time user input
